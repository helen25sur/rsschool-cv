## About me

My current objective is to change the job and deepen into the area of WEB-development, as my current occupation has awoken this interest. I have been leading and editing the website of the National University “Odessa Law Academy” since 2017 applying HTML and CSS.

I have decided to acquire new competencies in order to become a professional. I hope to succeed because I am:

- goal-oriented and self-motivated;
- diligent and hard-working;
- concentrated and have analytical thinking;
- can perform as a team-player or solo;
- quick learner and strive to new vocational knowledge.
